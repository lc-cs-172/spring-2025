# Assignment #5: Using Objects

This assignment is meant to illustrate the benefits of abstractions and
composition afforded by object-oriented programming.

After completing the previous assignment, you should have developed an
abstraction for computation with vectors (`vector.py`).  That assignment also
came with a class simulating objects subject to a two-dimensional gravitational
field (`body.py`).  That simulation code uses tuples to store locations,
velocity, and forces.  In this assignment you are asked to refactor `body.py`
and use your `Vector` class instead of the tuples.  Make all the appropriate
changes.  Test your code with the two example use of `body.py` packaged with the
previous assignment.

## What To Hand In

Upload the refactored `body.py` (it's a text file, no need to convert it to
such).
