# Assignment #6: Sorting

The assignment is meant to introduce you to one of the most studied algorithm
in computer science: Sorting.

In this assignment, you will be working with two files:

* [`selection.py`](./selection.py) and
* [`selection_test.py`](./selection_test.py)

Complete the `sort` function in `selection.py`.

## Hints

* Copy the code found in [note 34](../../../notes/note-34.md) verbatim (except
  rename the variable `x` and call it `jmin` instead, it'll make the code more
  readable).

* Supply any additional lines of code necessary to complete the function.

* Use the unit tests to check your implementation.

* Do not modify `selection_test.py`.

## What To Hand In

Upload the completed `selection.py`.
