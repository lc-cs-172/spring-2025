# Assignment #3: Recursion Drill

This assignment is meant to give you practice writing recursive methods.

You are asked to implement 10 recursive functions.  The descriptions of these
functions are given in `recursion2.py` along with their signatures.  As given,
these functions return a constant value so that the associated unit tests run
without raising exceptions.  Replace these `return` statements with the
necessary Python statements to implement the described functionality.  You must
use recursion, no loops (`if` statements are okay).

Implement one function and check that its associated unit test passes before
moving on to the next function.

## What To Hand In

Upload your version of `recursion2.py` (it's a text file, no need to convert it
to such).
