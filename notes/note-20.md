## Recursion

* Algorithmically: Solving a problem by a *divide-and-conquer* or
  *decrease-and-conquer* strategy

* Semantically: A function that calls itself (directly or indirectly)

## Pitfalls of recursion

* Missing base case
* No guarantee of convergence
* Excessive recomputation
* Excessive memory requirements

## Call graph

According to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph) Wikipedia article,
a *call graph* [...] represents the relationships between functions in a
computer program.
