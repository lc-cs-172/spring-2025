and pay attention to the terms described in the sections below.

## Abstract data type

One can think of an abstract data type as

* attributes (i.e., values) + behaviors (i.e., methods or operations)

For example, the type `int` represents the integers with the usual operations
defined on members of this set (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication,
etc.).

## Some pillars of object-oriented programming

* Abstraction: don't depend on implementation details
* Encapsulation: prevent depending on implementation
* Polymorphism: implementation determined by its type
