## Course Information

Lewis & Clark College, Spring 2025  
CS 172, Section 01  
Monday/Wednesday/Friday 10:20-11:20 AM  
Olin 305

**Google Classroom:**  I will use Google Classroom throughout the semester to
share assignment due dates and details about exams, and track your grade.


**GitHub:**  I will use GitHub to share notes, activities, and assignments.

**Microsoft Visual Studio Code:**  I will mostly use
[Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/development_tools/vs_code.md)
throughout the semester for live coding session.  If you have never used an
integrated developing environment (IDE), I would recommend that you use this
one.  It is installed on the computers in Olin 305.  It is relatively easy to
[install](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/development_tools/vs_code.md)
on your computer (if you run into issues, talk to the instructor, the TA, or
Jorge, the lab administrator).

## Course Description

Computer Science II introduces object-oriented programming, data structures,
more sophisticated algorithms than you saw in CS 171, and some basics of
software development.  The class is taught with Python, but you are not expected
to have any prior experience with this language.

## Course Goals

One goal is to add important programming concepts not already covered in CS 171.
They include recursion, object-oriented programming, inheritance, overloading,
and overriding.

Another goal is to present a few important data structures and algorithms, such
as linked lists, stacks, queues, searching, and sorting.

A third goal is to introduce techniques to analyze the performance of these data
structures and algorithms.  In particular, these techniques will give us means
to evaluate the relative performance of two algorithms or data structures.

A fourth goal is to introduce unit testing, one form of software testing.

A last goal is to give you practice writing larger, more sophisticated programs
using functional decomposition.

This class is *not* about the nuts and bolts of programming in Python.  This
class is about learning how to program.  Period.  We happen to use Python for
our programming activities.  But the skills you are about to learn in this
class are applicable to any other programming languages.

To help you learn these skills, I may, in some activities and programming
assignments, explicitly forbid you to use some specific features of Python.

## Learning Outcomes

The learning objectives for this class include:

1. Read and write code in the Python programming language, observing stylistic
   conventions.
2. Design and implement object-oriented applications incorporating both new code
   and existing libraries
3. Solve computational problems using recursion.
4. Use, implement, explain, and compare various data structures and algorithms.
   Data structures include stacks, queues, and lists.  Implementations include
   array-based and linked versions.
5. Write unit tests.

## Office Hours

I hope you will visit me throughout the term, so I can learn more about your
interests and answer your questions.  No appointment is necessary to see me
during office hours; simply stop by BoDine 302A.  If you would like to make an
appointment outside of my office hours, please email me at alaink@lclark.edu.

## Requirements

All assignments will be posted on GitHub and will be submitted through Google
Classroom.  They are designed to help you master and apply what we are learning
in class.  **Assignments are due on Friday at 11:59 PM of the week they are
due.**  Points will be taken off if submitted late; in some cases late
assignments will not receive any credit.

## Grade Scale

I will use the following scale to compute your final grade:

Grade            | Point Range
-|-
**A− or A**      | 90-100
**B−, B, or B+** | 80-89
**C or C+**      | 72-79
**C−**           | 70-71
**D+**           | 68-69
**D**            | 62-67
**F**            |  0-61

Note that I may adjust your final grade in the class up or down in light of your
participation, attendance, and overall commitment to the class.  The grade of
“B”  reflects work that is normally done thoughtfully and thoroughly by
students.  The grade of “A” is earned by students who consistently do
outstanding work and who show an unusually strong commitment to being active
participants in the learning experience.

## Grading

* Class participation: 10%
* Individual programming assignments: 30%
* Group programming assignments: 30%
* Exams: 30%

Group programming assignments will done in pairs.

There will be two midterms and one final exam.  All the exams have the same
weight.  Of the three exams, I will drop the worst score.  In other words, the
exam component of your final grade will be the arithmetic average of your two
highest scores.

The exams are pen-and-paper tests given in the classroom.  Each exam will
consist of a number of one-star and two-star questions drawn from the
questions/answers sections of relevant pages in
[Pythonorama](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama).  The midterms will
have 10 questions each; the final will have 20 questions.  Midterm #1 will cover
topics in the Monolithic Main Methods and Functional Decomposition modules.
Midterm #2 will cover topics in Recursion and Object-oriented Programming
modules.  Final is comprehensive.

## Helpful Tips

**Attend all class meetings.**  The classroom is a place to learn new concepts,
to work through activities to reinforce learning, and to engage in discussions
with your professors and your peers.  If you have to miss class for illness or
an emergency, please let me know and try to ask a peer to take notes for you.
Being on time for class is also important.

**Collaborate with your peers.**  Form a study group and get together to talk
about the class.  The sooner you get together with your peers to talk about the
class, the better.  That way you can look over your notes right away, when they
are still fresh.  You are likely to learn a lot from one another and find
places where you need clarification from me before exam-time.  You may
collaborate on assignments, but you need to develop your own answers.

**Divide and conquer — split up some of the exam review.**  When it comes time
to review and to prepare for exams, you will have another great opportunity for
collaboration.  Split up readings and lectures among a group of people and have
each person prepare parts of the study guides and potential answers to exam
questions.  Then trade study guides and get together for your own review
sessions.

**Get to know your professor.**  Please feel free to stop by my office hours
early in the semester, and stop by often.  I am here not only to answer
questions about the lectures and the assignments, but also to engage in
conversation about computer science (and life!) as a whole.  I love hearing from
students because you are the keepers of many interesting ideas and perspectives.

## High-level Schedule

## Course Policies

**Attendance.**  Attendance is key to master the topics covered in this course.
Participation in discussion and activities will help gain that proficiency.
If you must miss a class for any reason, please obtain information about the
the missed class from your classmates.  Missing the midterm or final exam
disadvantages not only you, but also your classmates and me.  Therefore, make-up
exams will only be given for very serious circumstances.

**Accommodations.**  Please see me if there are accommodations that could help
you learn more effectively in this class or if you are experiencing barriers to
accessibility in our class.  Some kinds of accommodations may require
documentation through the
[Office of Student Accessibility](https://www.lclark.edu/offices/student-accessibility/).
If you plan to take exams in the Office of Student Accessibility, please
schedule with them and let me know well in advance of the exam.

**Course Withdrawals.**  You may drop this course on WebAdvisor by Friday of the
second week of class and no W grade will appear on your transcript.  After the
second week and before 4 PM on Friday of the 10th week, you can withdraw from
the course by submitting a Course Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s Office.  In
this case, a W grade will appear on your transcript.  **The last day to withdraw
from this class is Friday, November 8th.**  It is not possible for me to
authorize your withdrawal from the course after that date.  At that point, you
will need to complete the course and take whatever grade you have earned.  If
you have questions or concerns about your performance in the course, please talk
with me before **November 8th**.

**Academic Integrity.**  Academic integrity is an essential part of learning.
Plagiarism, cheating, or the deliberate misrepresentation of information will
result in failure of this course.  Please avoid any behavior that may be
reasonably viewed as suspicious.  Remember that helping a classmate to cheat
counts as cheating.  If you have any questions about the use of generative AI
technology (e.g., ChatGPT) or plagiarism boundaries or about what type of
material you can access while working on an assignment, please see me before you
turn in your work.  If you have any questions or concerns about academic
honesty, please come see me or refer to Lewis & Clark’s
[Academic Integrity Policy](https://docs.lclark.edu/undergraduate/policiesprocedures/academicintegrity/).

**Other.**  All college policies govern this course.  Please see the
[Undergraduate Catalog](https://college.lclark.edu/catalog/) for any issues not
covered in this syllabus.
